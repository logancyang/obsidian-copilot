## The What

*Copilot for Obsidian* is your in‚Äëvault AI assistant with chat-based vault search, web and YouTube support, powerful context processing, and ever-expanding agentic capabilities within Obsidian's highly customizable workspace - all while keeping your data under **your** control.

## The Why
Today's AI giants want **you trapped**: your data on their servers, prompts locked to their models, and switching costs that keep you paying. When they change pricing, shut down features, or terminate your account, you lose everything you built.

We are building the opposite. Our goal is to create a portable agentic experience with no provider lock-in. **Data is always yours.** Use whatever LLM you like. Imagine that a brand new model drops, you run it on your own hardware, and it already knows about you (*long-term memory*), knows how to run *the same commands and tools* you have defined over time (as just markdown files), and becomes the thought partner and assistant that you *own*. This is AI that grows with you, not a subscription you're hostage to.

This is the future we believe in. If you share this vision, please support this project!

## Key Features

- **üîí Your data is 100% yours**: Local search and storage, and full control of your data if you use self-hosted models.
- **üß† Bring Your Own Model**: Tap any OpenAI-compatible or local model to uncover insights, spark connections, and create content. 
- **üñºÔ∏è Multimedia understanding**: Drop in webpages, YouTube videos, images, PDFs, EPUBS, or real-time web search for quick insights.
- **üîç Smart Vault Search**: Search your vault with chat, no setup required. Embeddings are optional. Copilot delivers results right away.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Composer and Quick Commands**: Interact with your writing with chat, apply changes with 1 click.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Project Mode**: Create AI-ready context based on folders and tags. Think NotebookLM but inside your vault!
- **ü§ñ Agent Mode (Plus)**: Unlock an autonomous agent with built-in tool calling. No commands needed. Copilot automatically triggers vault, web searches or any other relevant tool when relevant.

<p align="center">
  <em>Copilot's Agent can call the proper tools on its own upon your request.</em>

## Copilot V3 is a New Era üî•

After months of hard work, we have revamped the codebase and adopted a new paradigm for our agentic infrastructure. It opens the door for easier addition of agentic tools (MCP support coming). We will provide a new version of the documentation soon. Here is a couple of new things that you cannot miss!

- FOR ALL USERS: You can do vault search out-of-the-box **without building an index first** (Indexing is still available but optional behind the "Semantic Search" toggle in QA settings).
- FOR FREE USERS: Image support and chat context menu are available to all users starting from v3.0.0!
- FOR PLUS USERS: **Autonomous agent** is available with vault search, web search, youtube, composer and soon a lot other tools! **Long-term memory** is also a tool the agent can use by itself starting from 3.1.0!

Read the [Changelog](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/releases/tag/3.0.0).

## Why People Love It ‚ù§Ô∏è

- *"Copilot is the missing link that turns Obsidian into a true second brain. I use it to draft investment memos with text, code, and visuals‚Äîall in one place. It‚Äôs the first tool that truly unifies how I search, process, organize, and retrieve knowledge without ever leaving Obsidian. With AI-powered search, organization, and reasoning built into my notes, it unlocks insights I‚Äôd otherwise miss. My workflow is faster, deeper, and more connected than ever‚ÄîI can‚Äôt imagine working without it."*¬†- @jasonzhangb, Investor & Research Analyst
- *"Since discovering Copilot, my writing process has been completely transformed. Conversing with my own articles and thoughts is the most refreshing experience I‚Äôve had in decades.‚Äù*¬†- Mat QV, Writer
- *"Copilot has transformed our family‚Äînot just as a productivity assistant, but as a therapist. I introduced it to my non‚Äëtechnical wife, Mania, who was stressed about our daughter‚Äôs upcoming exam; within an hour, she gained clarity on her mindset and next steps, finding calm and confidence."*¬†- @screenfluent, A Loving Husband

## **FAQ**

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why isn‚Äôt Vault search finding my notes?</strong></summary>

If you're using the Vault QA mode (or the tool <code>@vault</code> in Plus), try the following:

- Ensure you have a working embedding model from your AI model's provider (e.g. OpenAI). Watch this video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- Ensure your Copilot indexing is up-to-date. Watch this video: [Vault Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLMWE8WRFU)
- If issues persist, run <strong>Force Re-Index</strong> or use <strong>List Indexed Files</strong> from the Command Palette to inspect what's included in the index.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Don‚Äôt switch embedding models after indexing</strong>‚Äîit can break the results.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why is my AI model returning error code‚ÄØ429: ‚ÄòInsufficient Quota‚Äô?</strong></summary>

Most likely this is happening because you haven‚Äôt configured billing with your chosen model provider‚Äîor you‚Äôve hit your monthly quota. For example, OpenAI typically caps individual accounts at $120/month. To resolve:

- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch the ‚ÄúAI Model Setup‚Äù video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- üîç Verify your billing settings in your OpenAI dashboard
- üí≥ Add a payment method if one isn‚Äôt already on file
- üìä Check your usage dashboard for any quota or limit warnings

If you‚Äôre using a different provider, please refer to their documentation and billing policies for the equivalent steps.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why am I getting a token limit error?</strong></summary>

Please refer to your model provider‚Äôs documentation for the context window size.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you set a large <strong>max token limit</strong> in your Copilot settings, you may encounter this error.

- <strong>Max tokens</strong> refers to <em>completion tokens</em>, not input tokens.
- A higher output token limit means less room for input!

üß† Behind-the-scenes prompts for Copilot commands also consume tokens, so:

- Keep your message length short
- Set a reasonable max token value to avoid hitting the cap

üí° For QA with unlimited context, switch to the <strong>Vault QA</strong> mode in the dropdown (Copilot v2.1.0+ required).

</details>
