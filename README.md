## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Copilot for Obsidian is now available in **Obsidian Community Plugin**!

- Open Community Plugins settings page, click on the Browse button.
- Search for "Copilot" in the search bar and find the plugin with this exact name.
- Click on the Install button.
- Once the installation is complete, enable the Copilot plugin by toggling on its switch in the Community Plugins settings page.

Now you can see the chat icon in your leftside ribbon, clicking on it will open the chat panel on the right! Don't forget to check out the Copilot commands available in the commands palette!

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Manual Installation
- Go to the latest release
- Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` and put them under `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-copilot/` in your vault
- Open your Obsidian settings > Community plugins, and turn on `Copilot`.

## üîî Note
- The chat history is not saved by default. Please use "**Save as Note**" to save it. The note will have a title `Chat-Year_Month_Day-Hour_Minute_Second`, you can change its name as needed.
- "**New Chat**" clears all previous chat history. Again, please use "**Save as Note**" if you would like to save the chat.
- "**Use Active Note as Context**" creates a local vector index for the active note so that you can chat with super long note! To start the QA, please switch from "Conversation" to "QA: Active Note" in the Mode Selection dropdown.
- You can set a very long context in the setting "**Conversation turns in context**" if needed.

#### üì£ Again, please always be mindful of the API cost if you use GPT-4 with a long context!

## ü§î FAQ (please read before submitting an issue)

<details>
  <summary>It's not using my note as context</summary>

  - Please don't forget to switch to "**QA: Active Note**" in the Mode Selection dropdown in order to start the QA. Copilot does not have your note as context in "Conversation" mode.
    <img src="./images/faq-mode-switch.png" alt="Settings" width="500">
  - In fact, you don't have to click the button on the right before starting the QA. Switching to QA mode in the dropdown directly is enough for Copilot to read the note as context. The button on the right is only for when you'd like to manually rebuild the index for the active note, like, when you'd like to switch context to another note, or you think the current index is corrupted because you switched the embedding provider, etc.
  - Reference issue: https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/issues/51

<details>
  <summary>Unresponsive QA when using Huggingface as the Embedding Provider</summary>

  - Huggingface Inference API is free to use. It can give errors such as 503 or 504 frequently at times because their server has issues. If it's an issue for you, please consider using OpenAI or CohereAI as the embedding provider. Just keep in mind that OpenAI costs more, especially with very long notes as context.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>"model_not_found"</summary>

  - A common misunderstanding I see is that some think they have access to GPT-4 API when they get ChatGPT Plus subscription. That is not true. *You need to get access to GPT-4 API to use the GPT-4 model in this plugin*. Please check if you can successfully use your model in the OpenAI playground first https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat&model=gpt-4. If not, you can apply for GPT-4 API access here https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api. Once you have access to the API, you can use GPT-4 with this plugin without the ChatGPT Plus subsciption!
  - Reference issue: https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/issues/3#issuecomment-1544583676
</details>
<details>
  <summary>"insufficient_quota"</summary>

  - It might be because you haven't set up payment for your OpenAI account, or you exceeded your max monthly limit. OpenAI has a cap on how much you can use their API, usually $120 for individual users.
  - Reference issue: https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/issues/11
</details>
<details>
  <summary>"context_length_exceeded"</summary>

  - GPT-3.5 has a 4096 context token limit, GPT-4 has 8K (there is a 32K one available to the public soon per OpenAI). So if you set a big token limit in your Copilot setting, you can get this error. Note that the prompts behind the scenes for Copilot commands can also take up tokens, so please limit your message length to avoid this error. (For QA with Unlimited Context, use the "QA: Active Note" chain in the dropdown! Requires Copilot v2.1.0.)
  - Reference issue: https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/issues/1#issuecomment-1542934569
</details>

When opening an issue, please include relevant console logs. You can go to Copilot's settings and turn on "Debug mode" at the bottom for more console messages!

## üìù Planned features (based on feedback)
- More standard prompts that can be used with commands
- User custom prompts
- Online prompt library access
- Unlimited context for a collection of notes
- Integration with more LLMs, including open-source and local ones
