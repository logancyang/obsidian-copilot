# **🙋‍♂️ FAQ**

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why isn’t Vault search finding my notes?</strong></summary>

If you're using the Vault QA mode (or the tool <code>@vault</code> in Plus), try the following:

- Ensure you have a working embedding model from your AI model's provider (e.g. OpenAI). Watch this video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- Ensure your Copilot indexing is up-to-date. Watch this video: [Vault Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLMWE8WRFU)
- If issues persist, run <strong>Force Re-Index</strong> or use <strong>List Indexed Files</strong> from the Command Palette to inspect what's included in the index.
- ⚠️ <strong>Don’t switch embedding models after indexing</strong>—it can break the results.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why is my AI model returning error code 429: ‘Insufficient Quota’?</strong></summary>

Most likely this is happening because you haven’t configured billing with your chosen model provider—or you’ve hit your monthly quota. For example, OpenAI typically caps individual accounts at $120/month. To resolve:

- ▶️ Watch the “AI Model Setup” video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- 🔍 Verify your billing settings in your OpenAI dashboard
- 💳 Add a payment method if one isn’t already on file
- 📊 Check your usage dashboard for any quota or limit warnings

If you’re using a different provider, please refer to their documentation and billing policies for the equivalent steps.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why am I getting a token limit error?</strong></summary>

Please refer to your model provider’s documentation for the context window size.

⚠️ If you set a large <strong>max token limit</strong> in your Copilot settings, you may encounter this error.

- <strong>Max tokens</strong> refers to <em>completion tokens</em>, not input tokens.
- A higher output token limit means less room for input!

🧠 Behind-the-scenes prompts for Copilot commands also consume tokens, so:

- Keep your message length short
- Set a reasonable max token value to avoid hitting the cap

💡 For QA with unlimited context, switch to the <strong>Vault QA</strong> mode in the dropdown (Copilot v2.1.0+ required).
