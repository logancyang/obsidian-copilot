3. Clone the forked repo into your vault's `plugins` folder.
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

6. Ensure your editor respects the `.editorconfig` and Prettier settings.
7. Run `npm run dev` in your repo to see the effect of your changes.
8. Before committing, run `npm run format` to ensure all files are properly formatted.
9. When you are ready to make a pull request, ensure to make your changes in **a branch on your fork**, and then submit a pull request to the **main repo**.
