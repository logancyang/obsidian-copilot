**Example conversation**:

```
You: Can you analyze my [[Weekly Review - March 2024]] note and suggest action items?

Claude: I'll analyze your weekly review note. Let me examine the content...

[Uses file reading tool automatically]

Based on your March 2024 weekly review, I found several areas that could benefit from action items:

1. **Project Management**: You mentioned feeling overwhelmed with multiple projects...
2. **Learning Goals**: The Python course you started needs dedicated time blocks...
3. **Health & Wellness**: Your note mentions skipping workouts due to work pressure...

Would you like me to create a structured action plan for any of these areas?
```

### 2. Vault QA Mode

**Best for**: Searching across your entire vault, pattern recognition, knowledge synthesis

**Features with Claude Code**:

- **Instant search**: No need to build embeddings first
- **Semantic understanding**: Finds conceptually related content
- **Cross-reference analysis**: Connects ideas across different notes
- **MCP-powered search**: Uses advanced search tools automatically

**Example conversation**:

```
You: What patterns can you identify in my journaling about productivity over the last year?

Claude: I'll search through your vault for productivity-related journal entries and analyze patterns...

[Automatically uses vault search tools]

After analyzing your productivity journaling patterns, I've identified several key trends:

**Seasonal Patterns**:
- Higher productivity mentioned in fall months (September-November)
- Productivity dips during summer vacation periods
- January shows goal-setting spikes but execution drops by February

**Weekly Patterns**:
- Most productive days: Tuesday-Thursday
- Monday shows "restart anxiety" themes
- Friday entries focus on weekly reflection

**Productivity Strategies Evolution**:
- Early 2024: Time-blocking focused
- Mid-year: Shifted to energy management
- Recent: Integration of mindfulness practices

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these patterns or suggest optimization strategies based on what's worked for you?
```

**Morning Planning**:

```
Review my calendar for today and my project notes. Help me prioritize my tasks and identify potential conflicts.
```

**End-of-Day Review**:

```
Based on today's notes and completed tasks, help me prepare tomorrow's focus areas.
```

#### Weekly Workflows

**Weekly Review**:

```
Analyze my notes from this week and identify:
1. Key accomplishments
2. Unfinished items that need attention
3. Patterns or insights I should be aware of
```

**Planning Sessions**:

```
Help me plan next week by analyzing:
- Upcoming deadlines in my project notes
- Recurring commitments in my calendar
- Goal progress from my tracking notes
```
