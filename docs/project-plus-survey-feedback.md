# Project plus mode (ignite) user survey feedback

## fokus

by day, my roles are typically sales and goals/outcomes/accomplishments focused. I'd like a goal oriented interface b/c that's many/most times for me higher in value.

This does seem like a logical progression of Copilot vs. something net new. Chat made sense first since that is the most common, and then the idea becomes "why are people chatting with their notes. what are they hoping to accomplish>?

Goal: I need to learn Davinci Resolve to support VR180 workflows vs. 4 different chat conversations that are spread out over days, weeks.

## ARME

I don't think I'll need Ignite, but since I was tagged, from what I can see there is a knowledge gap section, which means that if something is not in the user's notes, it needs to come from the internet. For this I'll suggest having the possibility to start a deep research so that Ignite can find online the missing information from multiple websites, and then write the report in one or more markdown notes, so the user can edit them if they wish and also they become actual notes so the user doesn't have knowledge gaps anymore

Love the idea - it reminds me a bit of plan mode from cursor - and I think incorporating these as new features for Project Mode 2.0 - feels like a natural evolution.

This expansion would effectively allow each Project to be converted to an agent - and then bring things one step closer to one of the big features I have always wanted - which is to have multiple projects/ multiple agents collaborate towards an objective. Being able to also select the LLM that are designed for agentic use (like Kimi K2 etc ) can then finally be leveraged.

These would bring very advanced AI features to Co-Pilot - and seriously empower the community of open source and privacy first user base (with potential/planned offline capabilities). This is something that has insane value (tremendously marketable) and nothing like which exists at present.

Add in MCP integration to this and now you can add thousands of other tools to power the agentic workflow from your very own vault data and use the Co-Pilot engine to drive workflows outside Obsidian

I’m currently using bases to achieve this in a very deterministic way. I’m working on a project like “Learn Spanish”. Any resources I clip into obsidian I tag it with that project. Then I have a dynamic base on the project page to pull all of my resources. Then I can drag those reference link into copilot if I need to chat with them further.

Happy to provide you with more information. This is a very recent addition to my workflow, so it hasn't been stress-tested for more than a month. So take all of it with a grain of salt. For active projects, I have about seven at the moment, but I know I need to keep this down to maintain my focus. Mind you, projects can be big or small. I see a project as anything with more than one task that needs to be completed in order for it to be ticked off. For now, the manual tagging process is working fine, and it keeps all of the resources really focused. But again, I am at the very beginning of this process, and I only have about 20 or so resources with about 3-4 being assigned to each project. I have gone out and searched for these resources specifically for these projects. Where I do see manual tagging falling down in the future is when I spin up a new project which is related to something I've done in the past or to resources that I already have available to me, and it becomes unwieldy to sift through all of the resources I have, even though I have pretty robust categorization and metadata on them. It would be great if all the best resources got surfaced, and I got to choose which ones were included. I wouldn't want them added automatically because that could just muddy the context of the project, especially if I'm using AI.

In addition to chatting with the documents and resources, it would be good to have suggestions made around:
What tasks, insights, and useful practical tips can be applied to the current project
Identify any blind spots or gaps in my knowledge based on my plan or proactive planning
Planning suggestions based on the resources that I have

The most challenging thing I find about kicking off a project is the discovery phase:
Finding the resources
Pulling together the resources
Writing a plan for myself
Figuring out what the actual objective of this is
Deciding on whether it's actually worth it
